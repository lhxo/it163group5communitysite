            <h2>Feeling the Freeze? Find What Connects You!</h2>
            <p>It is often said that the Seattle locals have stern and secluded attitude which can feel isolating, also known as the Seattle Freeze. Seattle Comms was created with the idea that this notion of the freeze isn't all that true. The people of this city are kind, lively, and outgoing. This organization connects the greater Seattle with locals who have similar interests whether it is similar hobbies, interest groups, or workouts. Seattle Comms is here to help connect you to communities that fulfill you.</p>

            <p>Seattle Comms is the brainchild of Julio Ramos, Naran Torguud, and Christopher Yip. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, we all felt estranged to our social lives. Schools went online, restaurants became takeout, and everyone was locked indoors for a year. It has been difficult for many companies and communities during this time. So we came together to create safe place for people to connect again either online or in person as this pandemic slowly recuperates.</p>
