                        <p>SEVA “is an all-volunteer group of Seattle-area folks who are passionate about  all things having to do with electric cars… We participate in car shows, educational events and political events having to  do with electric vehicle legislation. But we mostly get together to have some plain, old fun at our free monthly meetings.”
                        SEVA meets monthly on the second Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the Church of the Nazarene in Wallingford.</p></li>
