                        <p>This group meets every Thursday evening for a run at your own pace (all levels welcome!), followed by hangin’ at one of the many local breweries in the area.” They urge you to “come out and meet other members of our community who believe that no run is complete without a tasty pint (or 3!) to wash it down.</p></li>

Come join your follow Seattleites for some runs, fun, and goal smashing throughout Washington and across the globe. We’ll be hosting runs and workouts several times a week throughout the city and building a community of running and training partners.”</p></li>
